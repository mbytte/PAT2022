There's a code on this. Let me see if I can crack it
#-Enter what letters you think are in the word
-If letters are not in the word they will appear in
 the 'wrong letters' box
-If you get a letter right it will appear wherever it 
 exists in the word
#Hm. A number. I should take note of this.
There's also a diary. Let me see what it says:
Dear Dairy
Today I found a buterfli. It was very big and very pretty and very cool. Mommy says that I am as pretty as it is.
-13 October

Dear Dairy
I am so sad. Steve pulled my hair and Mommy didn't punish him. Steve is so mean.
-16 October

Dear Dairy
Today Daddy came home looking a bit sick. Mommy says hes just caught the weather but I think hes just old.
-20 October

Dear Diary
Today I learned how to spell diary. Dairy is something that comes from a cow! Daddy is still sick and Steve has been gone for a few days. Mommy says he's gone on a trip. How come I couldnt go
-25 October

Dear Diary
I lost you for awhile! I found you today in the air vents. I wonder how you managed to get there. A lot of my toys have gone missing. Mommy says Im just forgetful.
-2 November

Dear Diary
I'm surprised that I still have you after all these years. Brings back memories of a simpler time. Perhaps I will continue writing in you, for the nostalgia of it. 
-2/4

Dear Diary
He seems to know my every move. Father has not come back yet and I fear for the worst. I miss Mother and wish she was here with me right now. I'm so alone down here. Hopefully someone will come for me soon. 
-6/5

Dear Diary
This will be my last entry. If someone ever finds this just know that I tried my best. He will never be able to get out; but in turn, neither will I. If you are reading this, get out of the house NOW. I've hidden clues in this room to aid in your escape. I must prepare now; he's found me.
-7/7
